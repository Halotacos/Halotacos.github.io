I can already tell


[16-Sep-18 11:09 PM] ❤Shortie Jessie❤#7693
This girl died
Because her bf cheated on her
She was a lost soul
And a virgin ghost
Poor ghosty
So she got in a girls body
To lose her virginity
But she thought it wasnt right
So she went to heaven instead of being a bitter soul
And her ex bf got in a car crash
MERRY CHRISTMAS
Oh
The end

Ok
Its a fake story btw


[16-Sep-18 11:12 PM] ＤＯＧＥ　ーし鬱#4278
My body is too tired to give a expression
So


[16-Sep-18 11:12 PM] ❤Shortie Jessie❤#7693
So this girl literally fell from heaven
Because she was meant to be in hell
She was a demon
But she got stuck in the human world
The only way to escape was to either become a bitter soul
Or make her way to the light of heaven
She was conflicted
She thought since im a demon i could get all these people
LONG STORY SHORT BECAUSE IM LAZY
She ended up going to hell

Specific accents within accents
I’m picky


[18-Sep-18 05:49 AM] James™#1747
hi Raishin


[18-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Z0diacL0rd#5632
Mine can be strong but if I watch YouTube all day I pick up an American accent
It’s weird


[18-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Raishin#2140
Oof whip


[18-Sep-18 05:50 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Like James’ accent is nice but Harry Potter’s is grating

[18-Sep-18 06:03 AM] Raishin#2140

[18-Sep-18 06:03 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I was like
All what I did for whip and he doesn’t even remember me
Oh
Cause Ene is vindictive and wanted revenge


[18-Sep-18 06:03 AM] Raishin#2140
Ene is an ass owner


[18-Sep-18 06:03 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
So I had skedaddle
Cupid Room is gone anyway
I think Ene gave up


[18-Sep-18 06:04 AM] Raishin#2140
Yep
So did the rest
Cause no mod was on


[18-Sep-18 06:05 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Also
I wouldn’t mind if my uniform was basic
But it’s not
Stupid blazer and stuff


[18-Sep-18 06:05 AM] Raishin#2140
Blazers are nice


[18-Sep-18 06:05 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

[18-Sep-18 06:06 AM] Raishin#2140
I’d take it off durin half the school day


[18-Sep-18 06:06 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I hate the gym uniform
The shorts are too short


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] Raishin#2140
Ooo


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I always feel so exposed


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] Raishin#2140
People here need to learn to get larger shorts


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I agree


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] Raishin#2140
2 people had their asses hanging out


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
If your booty cheeks are popping out
They’re too short for school


[18-Sep-18 06:07 AM] Raishin#2140
No one calls them out for that tho


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I hate swimming units


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] Raishin#2140
I don’t have that
Thankfully


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
But I’m happy


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] Raishin#2140
Skinny jeans are too tight


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
My school is adding esports as a unit to PE


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] Raishin#2140
Like my nuts are being crushed

I’ve never watched that anime

@Shadow.#4781 you better give me the damn cover

[18-Sep-18 06:14 AM] Shadow.#4781
Ok ok

Sure


[18-Sep-18 06:14 AM] Shadow.#4781
No need to swear


[18-Sep-18 06:14 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Shadow is such a good boy


[18-Sep-18 06:15 AM] Shadow.#4781
I'm down to watch a anime some time.
We can use something like rab.it or what ever it's called


[18-Sep-18 06:15 AM] Raishin#2140
@hellman007#5676 how not to summon a demon lord aye?


[18-Sep-18 06:15 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
BNHA IS MY FAV RN
I Want to rewatch the whole series


[18-Sep-18 06:15 AM] Raishin#2140
I didn’t think someone else would watch it


[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I’m kind of waiting for season 4 of Highschool DXD
uwu


[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Raishin#2140
Season 4 of high school dxd is ass
I don’t like the animation at all


[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Shadow.#4781
I've never watched it


[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
It’s out?!


[18-Sep-18 06:16 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah
I think so
They fully changed the animation style, it looks like a kids shoe
*show
Idk
I’ve only seen one episode


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Is it still sexual?


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah
But it’s just... not okay


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
The English dub is the best way to watch it


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Raishin#2140
Like I cant get the thought that the animation looks like a kids show


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
They take so many liberties


[18-Sep-18 06:17 AM] Shadow.#4781
Someone DM me the anime
I'll watch it tonight while I'm alone


[18-Sep-18 06:18 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289

[18-Sep-18 09:31 AM] Berry's prince#4765
Damn


[18-Sep-18 09:31 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
And the whole class got silent
She went on for ten minutes
And our teacher just let her
It was like a research paper
Like a PowerPoint presentation


[18-Sep-18 09:33 AM] Berry's prince#4765
Lol


[18-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Raishin#2140

***Slowly walks away***


[18-Sep-18 10:08 AM] James™#1747
***steps inside room*** Did i hear "Spider-man?"
I actually prefer to watch walkthroughs or someone else playing it rather than spending money on the game xd


[18-Sep-18 10:09 AM] Brandon#4581
***Walks back***
True lmao
Have you watched Spider-man yet?

You worked as a hotel clerk and then this hot chick flirted with you as she checked in. Before she left, she left a note to you that contains an invitation to her room. Your rock hard banana told your consiousness to go into the hot chick's room. When you got into her room, the chick is naked and ready. But you noticed that she has a banana as well and you realize she is in fact a dude. Luckily, you're into traps which made you even hornier from this realization. You both get on with it and she liked your professional service. For that, she gave you a tip of 55,462 and also an extra tip if you know what I mean.
why is this me


[18-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Brandon#4581

We need a Beyblade/Kingdom Hearts crossover. "It's Beyblade!" "No! It's Keyblade!"
HERE LIES SPIDERMAN'S HOPES AND DREAMS. What a baby.


[18-Sep-18 09:19 PM] Raishin#2140
Why would they add beyblade with kingdom hearts?


[18-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Caifabe#0887
I just thought it would be funny with the characters having arguments over which is better: beyblade or keyblade.


[18-Sep-18 09:20 PM] Raishin#2140
🤔


[18-Sep-18 09:21 PM] *•.¸♡ 𝓣𝓮𝓼𝓵𝓪 ♡¸.•*#6642

[18-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Caifabe#0887
We went from talking about emo music, to Kingdom Hearts/Beyblade, to Spider-Man (messages have been deleted), to this.


[18-Sep-18 09:22 PM] Shadow.#4781
Spider man deserved death
He didn't do anything in the movies

Hi emma


[19-Sep-18 04:39 AM] Visual#0166
Important in what way, almost half or more of  the stuff I study in school is just wasting my time


[19-Sep-18 04:39 AM] James™#1747
Eveything basically. Main important things is maths and English and Science.
Would you rather go to school and be able to speak properlly, or leave school at the age of 16/17 and have a childs mind. I mean come on. School is important.


[19-Sep-18 04:41 AM] Shadow.#4781
Yes, they teach you different things so you have multiple paths in the future. If they just made you learn on thing and you highly disliked it and there were no more jobs left for the career you wouldn't have a chance in life


[19-Sep-18 04:41 AM] James™#1747
Nope, never pointed a finger
Uhhh
No... thats wrong...
now im confused
wadu hek
You either go to school like, knowing new things, using new words, being able to talk and act like an adult or you lave school, learning nothing because you think it's a "waste of time" then going and speaking to someone knowing hardly anything and have no clue how to answer questions or have an adult conversation. So, what im saying is, go to school. Because whatever you dream maybe, you will need to learn things that you might not think you will need but actually do need.
You might end up putting something together, creating something, you need maths for that.
And regarding money, you need maths for that too
The first 3 years of school for me didnt seem important. But every year at school is important for your exams.
Imagine learning nothing those 3 years then going through exams
One thing i hated about school is doing classes that you dont ever need. Like Drama and Music and art... (depeneds if you like it). For me, im a gaming guy so i dislike drama and music.


[19-Sep-18 04:52 AM] Shadow.#4781
I have to do my selectives but im forced to do either, woodwork, Japanese, or Art
I'd love to do Japanese but I'm 3 years behind the whole class
Mhm


[19-Sep-18 04:55 AM] James™#1747
I hate myself for not listening in school and failing 90% of my exams and passing like 2 exams.

[19-Sep-18 02:46 PM] Raishin#2140
Why’s that


[19-Sep-18 02:48 PM] thevinyl(neko)#5256
Reason


[19-Sep-18 02:48 PM] Berry's prince#4765
4/15 ratio it’s pretty bad


[19-Sep-18 02:49 PM] Hazey#6699
you should go to lgbtq+ servers and try to advertise


[19-Sep-18 02:49 PM] thevinyl(neko)#5256
But how is everyone else


[19-Sep-18 02:49 PM] Raishin#2140
Would that be necessary?


[19-Sep-18 02:51 PM] totally not klop#0411
I didnt think these level of boredom were possible


[19-Sep-18 02:51 PM] Hazey#6699
fe*males* are more likely to experiment with their sexuality than **men**, so you can probably improve your ratio that way


[19-Sep-18 02:51 PM] totally not klop#0411
Im so bored im being active here
Thats crazy


[19-Sep-18 02:51 PM] Hazey#6699
i'd imagine you can find more on those servers


[19-Sep-18 02:51 PM] totally not klop#0411
Wow ur smart

But they dont listen to me


[19-Sep-18 02:52 PM] thevinyl(neko)#5256

@ChocoPudding#9452 #rules
the only rule for links is `10.) Do not post NSFW links or images `
it wasn't inappropriate, it was relevant to the topic

I wasn't going to click to find out? I don't know him, he could be a hacker lmao


[19-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Brandon#4581
tbh I don't think links should be allowed in general chat
Maybe make a links channel?


[19-Sep-18 08:36 PM] Em 🥀#0323
If they're relevant to the topic, they should be allowed

Depression is a result of chemical in-balances @NEP#3199

Not waning to do anything and nothing can cheer you up. Also when you feel like ending it all but you can’t bring urself to do it yet cause something is holding you back but you can’t seem to find what it is, maybe?


[19-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Em 🥀#0323
Feel free to check out #server-announcements if you would like to see any Suicide, Depression etc hotlines. Here really isn't the best place to ask for support. You can also vent your feelings or look for help in #rant-venting


[19-Sep-18 08:51 PM] Sleepie ♥#3301
Depression is a lack of motivation to do something, things you used to find fun and exciting now seem mundane, you realize how repetitive everything seems to be. None of your friends seem to be able to entertain you, nothing keeps you happy. Intense emotional stress and discomfort often occur during depression.

@hellman007#5676 To define a mental disorder is to define someones personality, it's saying "You are this way. That's that." there's no exact definition for any of it.

Hi everyone


[20-Sep-18 05:15 AM] Raishin#2140
Hello


[20-Sep-18 05:16 AM] James™#1747
hewwwo


[20-Sep-18 05:18 AM] Em 🥀#0323
Sad that we had to remove -hug for a bit
:(
Members dont know how to not abuse it and make it ping everyone


[20-Sep-18 05:18 AM] Raishin#2140
Sad


[20-Sep-18 05:18 AM] James™#1747
:(
Maybeh remove the perms to use @ everyone for members?
onyl mods should be able to do


[20-Sep-18 05:20 AM] Raishin#2140
^


[20-Sep-18 05:21 AM] James™#1747
That way no one apart from mods and up can @ everyone


[20-Sep-18 05:22 AM] Em 🥀#0323
Members couldnt @ everyone
they were doing hug and the hug command makes it ping the member they mention
I have to make it through the dyno bot specifically that it doesnt ping members but i’m on mobile so yeh


[20-Sep-18 05:23 AM] James™#1747
Yee, but if they are usign @ everyone, you can disable that perm?
oh


[20-Sep-18 05:23 AM] Shadow.#4781
Oof


[20-Sep-18 05:23 AM] Em 🥀#0323
Yeh
Members on discord sometimes dont know how to act like a ~~decent human being~~


[20-Sep-18 05:24 AM] James™#1747
true


[20-Sep-18 05:24 AM] Raishin#2140
Oof


[20-Sep-18 05:24 AM] Shadow.#4781
Easy fix would've been removing @ everyone perms for bots instead of disabling the whole command
Takes less time and you don't have to worry about allowing the bot the perms again because, let's be real when is a bot really gonna need @ everyone perms


[20-Sep-18 07:11 AM] Raishin#2140
*2 hrs later and no one has anything to say*


[20-Sep-18 07:15 AM] James™#1747
yeah but still.... people using @ everyone is annoying


[20-Sep-18 07:15 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah


[20-Sep-18 07:16 AM] James™#1747
and clearly doesnt show that you're mature *shrugs*

Oh master zeromus message?
When I read it the first time it didn’t sound creepy, but after you said that I reread it and it did sound just a tiny bit creepy
Well then, *master zeromus* I love making kids cry but you don’t see me saying that now do you??

[21-Sep-18 05:00 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Do you live in America?


[21-Sep-18 05:00 AM] Raishin#2140
No one says that


[21-Sep-18 05:00 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

[21-Sep-18 05:01 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
No? You won’t tell me?


[21-Sep-18 05:01 AM] Raishin#2140
Can’t you tell where you live? Like do you live in America? Or Australia?


[21-Sep-18 05:01 AM] Orbital#5826
Did your school ask you to put a tilda after everything you say?


[21-Sep-18 05:01 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I know for a fact that my education system is superior to yours.

[21-Sep-18 05:02 AM] Shadow.#4781
Oh?


[21-Sep-18 05:02 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Actually, I’d wager to say I’m far more intelligent than you.
Oh my heritage is no importance to you~

If you’re so smart you’d know you can’t judge something because you lack objectivity.


[21-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Raishin#2140
*coward*


[21-Sep-18 05:03 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
You can’t objectively judge something.
No, you exist to be a nonce.


[21-Sep-18 05:03 AM] Orbital#5826
You have no self criticism, because you're *always* right


[21-Sep-18 05:04 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
As an intellectual, I’m amazed you’d use “retarded”, don’t you have better words than insulting the mentally disabled?
Lmao, that’s all I needed.


[21-Sep-18 05:05 AM] Raishin#2140

[21-Sep-18 07:38 AM] NEP#3199
D&D is life


[21-Sep-18 07:38 AM] red#4629
I think playing D&D would be fun

Hmm I like d&d but never played it tho
I like the idea of kt

[21-Sep-18 07:39 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
No it isn't.


[21-Sep-18 07:39 AM] red#4629
Yeah it isss


[21-Sep-18 07:39 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
It depends


[21-Sep-18 07:39 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
It's literally a show.


[21-Sep-18 07:39 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
however
on what you're watching
if you watch something with lolis in it


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
That's like saying, "You're a nerd for watching family guy"


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
boom, you are nerd


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] red#4629
Only nerds watch anime
It’s a fact


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] NEP#3199
Yo, @hellman007#5676 what version of D&D does your DM use?


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
@ChocoPudding#9452  that's a legit argument, because you are a nerd for watching family guy


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
In Japan, anime is on television.
Like it's so commonplace.


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
@ChocoPudding#9452  Yeah, same with fuckin family guy


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Anime isn't anything but cartoons

[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] NEP#3199
Yeah, we call it versions here


[21-Sep-18 07:40 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
cartoons are for kiddos

who lack social skills often occurs with people watching anime
and shows for that matter

That's a stereotype.
Don't stereotype.

Anime is for the ones that like it, so if you don't like it, than keep your opinion to yourself

@hellman007#5676 I found Epic battle fantasy to be a little boring and repetitive


[21-Sep-18 08:08 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
@Shadow.#4781  I'll carry you m8 B-)


[21-Sep-18 08:08 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

epic battle fantasy sucks balls


[21-Sep-18 08:08 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I didn't find the battle system all that inspired
the characters were flat and annoying
and the art style wasn't very aesthetically pleasing


[21-Sep-18 08:09 AM] ＤＯＧＥ　ーし鬱#4278
someone was in the locker room in gym with a bicycle and said zoom every corner
@ChocoPudding#9452

3 and 4
Idk it's just not for me
As you exit your backyard, a dog from down the street bites your leg leaving you with deep cuts on your calf. You stumble with pain and kick the dog into your backyard before closing the gate. Later that day a Lost Dog poster is seen on the street offering a reward. You return the dog, only after receiving your 474,236 reward. He shouldn't have bit you on your own property.
I'm a monster

[21-Sep-18 02:29 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Fun fact
In Japan
You clean yourself before you go into the tub
So baths are for pleasure rather than cleaning

I don’t see the point in that tbh

[21-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Pacheco#3651
And nah @NEP#3199

oh! my name is taku!! hi


[21-Sep-18 06:42 PM] NEP#3199
@Pacheco#3651 One of most common problems we have to fix is people coming in with rats from tweakbox, and or app valley


[21-Sep-18 06:43 PM] unused account#5547
yeah apps like that i dont trust
jailbreaking has a huge community around it
ive always jailbroken and trust me they dont take malicious things lightly


[21-Sep-18 06:44 PM] NEP#3199
Yeah, at my workplace we have a lot of people wanting to jailbreak their phones


[21-Sep-18 06:45 PM] unused account#5547
its hard though
you have to wait with an outdated ios and its so painful
im still on ios 9
and shsh blobs are too much work
i cant even download some apps anymore because theyre ios 10+


[21-Sep-18 06:45 PM] NEP#3199
True, but we have a co-worker who has us up to IOS11


[21-Sep-18 06:46 PM] unused account#5547
like snapchat!! i have an outdated snapchat


[21-Sep-18 06:46 PM] NEP#3199
Oof mate


[21-Sep-18 06:46 PM] unused account#5547
and yeah its up to around ios 12 KINDA
but the thing is
i canr update to 12
since thanks to the jailbreaking team they changed the way they update with blobs
literally marking all the ones i saved invalid and only the slightly newer ones work
it upset me. so much.


[21-Sep-18 06:47 PM] NEP#3199
We just do it our selfs, It's safer and we can update when ever we want


[21-Sep-18 06:47 PM] unused account#5547
i mean i can update to 12
i meant 12 as in a jailbreakable version
you cant choose the ios version you update to thanks apple


[21-Sep-18 06:48 PM] NEP#3199
Yep... Welcome to Apple


[21-Sep-18 06:48 PM] unused account#5547
i swear android is so much more friendly
the phones come like theyre prejailbroken
so much customization


[21-Sep-18 06:48 PM] NEP#3199
yeah


[21-Sep-18 06:50 PM] unused account#5547
and you rarely find paid apps in their play store
i wish apple would b more like that some day


[21-Sep-18 06:51 PM] NEP#3199
Nope, They want money


[21-Sep-18 06:51 PM] unused account#5547
so?? android wants money too
and yet they give us what we want
apple
evenA AFTER you pay
doesnt give you any customization
ever


[21-Sep-18 06:52 PM] NEP#3199
Android makes money off of the opensource coding.


[21-Sep-18 06:53 PM] unused account#5547
but their phones lack in so many ways that apple is succeeding
apple is so blind
imagine how much theyd move forward if they made it open source too
theyd be superior in almost every way
and no one could rip off their code and succeed because apples already such a huge brand


[21-Sep-18 06:54 PM] NEP#3199
and the problem is that Apple keeps updating there security... thanks FBI


[21-Sep-18 06:54 PM] unused account#5547
you know
at one point
fbi wanted to install a backdoor in iphones
not sure when this was but a while ago
apple said no
then the fbi said that they did it anyway
it was so freaking scary


[21-Sep-18 06:55 PM] NEP#3199
Then Apple patched it XD


[21-Sep-18 06:56 PM] unused account#5547
thats the thing they didnt even know about it
idk what happened next tho
i HOPE they patched it


[21-Sep-18 06:56 PM] NEP#3199
They did, the day after
Cause Wiki leaks


[21-Sep-18 06:56 PM] unused account#5547
you know whats scary
apple could of lied
the fbi could have forced them to say they patched it
and we'll never know


[21-Sep-18 06:57 PM] NEP#3199
No, cause they are a international company with servers all over, so thanks to EU laws They had do


[21-Sep-18 06:58 PM] unused account#5547

[22-Sep-18 07:31 AM] unused account#5547

typing in general is practice


[22-Sep-18 07:34 AM] James™#1747
It's just this keyboard
gah it pisses me off
if have a keyboard with fat keys and i keep miss-typing everything
seriously triggering me


[22-Sep-18 07:35 AM] unused account#5547
thats why u never switch keyboards folks
ok ok pro tip
your pointer fingers should usually rest on the "f" and "j" keys
there should be tiny bumps on them in most keyboards


[22-Sep-18 07:38 AM] Berry's prince#4765
wait that’s what those bumps are for


[22-Sep-18 07:38 AM] James™#1747

[22-Sep-18 07:39 AM] Berry's prince#4765
Lol


[22-Sep-18 07:41 AM] James™#1747
because i dont smash the keys hard enough to actually make them register
which is why i miss-type so much

whats demi sexual


[22-Sep-18 04:50 PM] Brandon#4581
A demisexual is a person who does not experience sexual attraction unless they form an emotional connection. It's more commonly seen in, but by no means confined, to romantic relationships. The term demisexual comes from the orientation being "halfway between" sexual and asexual

[22-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Em 🥀#0323
that server got deleted because the owner was breaking t&s


[22-Sep-18 05:11 PM] Mr. KRABS#6306
Huh okay
So that's why it disappeared off my discord


[22-Sep-18 05:12 PM] Em 🥀#0323
the owner then made a new server, told us staff members [almost all staff members who are here] that we never helped the staff team, then banned us all after one disagreement, now is currently dealing with a bunch of raids [constantly] because the staff that used to be active and help out, got banned for no reason
Note: I was not even online during the disagreement, and was still banned for quote on quote "association"

The first Digimon product was the Digimon Virtual Pet, and as mentioned above, it made it's debut in Japan on June 26, 1997. The first Pokemon product to be released was Pokemon Red and Green for the Game Boy on February 27, 1996. This was about 16 months before Digimon's debut as a Tamagotchi virtual pet.


[23-Sep-18 12:28 AM] Andromeda#8585

It’s all good now, the admin staff on this sever is probably one of best of any sever I have ever been on. It’s really a warm and welcoming place and I’ve met so many nice people☺️☺️

[23-Sep-18 04:35 AM] James™#1747
Yus, thank you Shadow
And of course, thank you Lulu for telling someone. :)


[23-Sep-18 04:36 AM] 🖤Luna🖤#5936
But like me being in me in my pfp I kinda expect it now..


[23-Sep-18 04:36 AM] Shadow.#4781
Yeah, that makes our jobs 100 times easier when we get proof and told about the situation


[23-Sep-18 04:38 AM] James™#1747
Well, this is a important message to everyone: If you get any unwanted pictures or videos from someone via DM, or maybe a threat or a horrble message. Please contact a member of staff with proof and it will be dealt with accordingly. <3
Pinned a message.

Meh, i like to show some love in the server. Heart means you can trust the staff :)


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Greatest Duos#3913
damn, isn't there a block option for anyone that annoys you


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Guts#4487
=_=


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] James™#1747
Yeah there is
But
It literally doesnt do much


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Guts#4487
Mute.


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Shadow.#4781
Yes, you might block them
But many other people are in the server


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] James™#1747
It blocks them so they cant DM you but you can still see their messages


[23-Sep-18 04:42 AM] Guts#4487
Hm.
Quite useless then


[23-Sep-18 04:43 AM] unused account#5547
what!!
thats not how it works!!


[23-Sep-18 04:43 AM] Shadow.#4781
Who might also get the same message which doesn't really help at all


[23-Sep-18 04:43 AM] unused account#5547
if you block someone you cant see their messages unless you choose to
they basically hide all the messages
all that it says is "blocked message" until you click on it
and they cant tag you or dm you


[23-Sep-18 04:43 AM] Shadow.#4781
Yeah


[23-Sep-18 04:43 AM] Guts#4487

Well, ofc.


[23-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Caifabe#0887
Probably more shitposting than trolling.

Ugh
Trolls.
I hate then


[23-Sep-18 08:09 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
But often a cartoon is associated with actual cartoon shows.

you’ve obviously not seen the fandoms of cartoons


[23-Sep-18 08:09 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Not always, drawings Are usually done in cartoony art styles.
Your drawing, fits that style


[23-Sep-18 08:10 AM] Caifabe#0887
p0sh that shit be reminding me of Nightmare Before Christmas.


[23-Sep-18 08:10 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
Well, that could be seen as true, but also alot of more would be count as drawings
I mean
Cartoons*

Why?


[23-Sep-18 08:11 AM] Caifabe#0887
Technically a drawing is automatically a cartoon. It doesn't have to be moving to be a cartoon.


[23-Sep-18 08:11 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
First off, weeb means liking Japanese stuff but in offensively ways to actual Japanese culture.
Nothing wrong with that
Youre misusing otaku and weeb
99% of the Internet does and has. As a joking term, but it's kinda annoying lmao


[23-Sep-18 08:11 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289
A weeb is a person that's not Japanese, but wishes they were. they're obsessed with Japanese culture. they integrate Japanese words into every day language. they are brony tier disgusting.


[23-Sep-18 08:12 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Correct. That's not at all what any of us are tho.


[23-Sep-18 08:12 AM] big peepee p0sh#8289

[23-Sep-18 08:12 AM] Caifabe#0887

Unless you're, practising lines from those games and then saying them in public for no reason in everyday life, and dressing up like the characters when you go out for a walk, maybe then yes it does

[23-Sep-18 08:15 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
aka a white person trying to be japanese
appropriating the culture

Alright. This is just annoying at this point. Disrespecting the culture IS doing that in my opinion. But whatever. End the topic. Let's talk about something else.


[23-Sep-18 08:19 AM] Raishin#2140
But it makes it more special when she is online


[23-Sep-18 08:19 AM] Shadow.#4781
Which is 7 hours


[23-Sep-18 08:19 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

No she didn’t


[23-Sep-18 09:00 AM] Guts#4487
So she wanted it.


[23-Sep-18 09:00 AM] Raishin#2140
She just said reee

A shadow owns you


[23-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Guts#4487
The shadow of a shadow?

Chocolate Pudding.


[23-Sep-18 09:06 AM] Guts#4487
I understood...
I'm not that dumb


[23-Sep-18 09:06 AM] jason#0420
Go to IKEA and make that a date; they have a cafe


[23-Sep-18 09:06 AM] Guts#4487
Just a funny name.
=_=
Uh-huh.
Why "mousse"?


[23-Sep-18 09:07 AM] Raishin#2140
There needs to be a second music room


[23-Sep-18 09:07 AM] jason#0420
desert, reminding me of it when there was chocolate pudding


[23-Sep-18 09:07 AM] Guts#4487
Uh-huh.
Never tried.


[23-Sep-18 09:08 AM] Caifabe#0887
A music room for sharing musical tastes and then a music room for sharing music you've recorded yourself.
That would be cool.


[23-Sep-18 09:08 AM] Guts#4487
Hm.
Is chocolate pudding good?
First, is pudding good?
'cause i never tried.

nice Sora pfp


[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] Caifabe#0887
Thanks bro.
It's KH2 Sora.


[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] Final#6406
ik lol im a huge fan


[23-Sep-18 09:34 AM] Caifabe#0887
Saaaaaaame
I'm super pumped for KH3.


[23-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Final#6406
sora vs aqua


[23-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Caifabe#0887
I KNOW
THAT WAS SO COOL


[23-Sep-18 09:35 AM] Final#6406
even tho it was only 30 seconds


[23-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Caifabe#0887
Did you watch the extended BH6 trailer?


[23-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Final#6406
you know it


[23-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Caifabe#0887
DATA-RIKU BEING NORTED
I have a feeling Nomura's trying to make Re:Coded relevant.


[23-Sep-18 09:37 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Uh where is Kairi as a playable character?


[23-Sep-18 09:37 AM] Caifabe#0887
Not announced yet.


[23-Sep-18 09:37 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I've wanted to have her playable from day 1


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
I hope Kairi becomes playable. Even if it's only for a brief moment during the final boss a'la playing as Riku during final Xemnas in KH2 it would still be cool.


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Final#6406
give me Lea and ill be good


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
YEEEEES LEA


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Fuck lea


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
EXCUSE ME


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Final#6406
or roxas


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
😛


[23-Sep-18 09:38 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Lea was just a dirty copy


[23-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Caifabe#0887
Lea is Axel's original human form


[23-Sep-18 09:39 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
lea is irrelevant


[23-Sep-18 09:39 AM] Caifabe#0887
Lea has a keyblade and is most likely going to be one of the seven guardians of light.


[23-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Final#6406
i think riku is the other character


[23-Sep-18 09:40 AM] Caifabe#0887
I wouldn't call that irrelevant


[23-Sep-18 09:40 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Kairi > Lea
K A I R I > L E A
change my mind


[23-Sep-18 09:41 AM] Caifabe#0887
I think it's gonna be Sora and Riku playable, but during the final boss there will be a section where all seven lights are taking on Xehanort and we will get to play as all seven, so like, two minutes as Sora, then a slow-motion blur effect and we're playing two minutes as Riku, then so on with all seven lights.


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Aqua is best girl even though she's evil now


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Caifabe#0887
Like, with Lea, Kairi, whoever else (I'm tired and can't think right now)


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Bet a quest is to purify her


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Final#6406
0.2 told us that


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] Caifabe#0887
In the most recent trailer it showed her at one point in her un-Norted form so I'm assuming we save her at some point.


[23-Sep-18 09:42 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I think that was flash back before she got norted


[23-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Caifabe#0887
Could be


[23-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Final#6406
it is


[23-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Caifabe#0887
Ah OK


[23-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Final#6406
vanni did the same thing in bbs remember


[23-Sep-18 09:43 AM] Caifabe#0887

i got the kh2 plat
kh1 i need to synth stuff


[23-Sep-18 09:48 AM] Caifabe#0887
I'm gonna try to get all the plats at some point.
Last thing I did in KH1 was seal Hollow Bastion's keyhole and win the Hades Cup.

@ChocoPudding#9452 give me ur opinions
if 5 more characters were to get into smash
who do you think is most likely
or that you want


[23-Sep-18 09:53 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Geno
Shadow tbh


[23-Sep-18 09:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
YES
FINALLY SOMEONE UNDERSTANDS


[23-Sep-18 09:54 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Daisy Kong  echo fighter


[23-Sep-18 09:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Literally any smash streamer i've seen is like
"Shadow for smash!"
but like
any person irl i meet is like
"nah he's not getting in, he's lame"
im just like
He's one of the 2 most requested echos


[23-Sep-18 09:54 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Honestly think Sora or Lightning has a good chance


[23-Sep-18 09:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and he's also one of the 2 most OBVIOUS echoes
honestly hear me out
We're totally getting another square character
But
that leaves a problem
geno is technically squares property
So it'll either be Geno or Sora
but
they didnt say anything about echoes


[23-Sep-18 09:55 AM] Final#6406
sora is unlikely


[23-Sep-18 09:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
so maybe
We'll get Geno
and Zack Fair


[23-Sep-18 09:55 AM] Final#6406
remember he's disney also


[23-Sep-18 09:56 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
as an echo
Of Cloud


[23-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Final#6406
the game already sold me with shulk returning but ill buy if we get shadow


[23-Sep-18 09:56 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
We know at this point, its basically confirmed we're getting Ken and a Pokemon gen 7 character
So 5 other characters you think we're getting and give a brief sentence on why
GO

Romeo and Juliet law?
This doesn't seem legal.


[23-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Final#6406
Shadow because lets be honest, he should have been playable since sm4sh
Geno because he's the only square character that makes sense
wait  a minute


[23-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Shadow.#4781
What's up fuckers


[23-Sep-18 10:01 AM] Final#6406

[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Final#6406
I would say waluigi but he has no qualities and he's already an assist trophy so no hope for him


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Gemmy#6395
@unused account#5547 What gender do you think i am?


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Caifabe#0887
I want Sora in Smash but it's not gonna happen because technically he's Disney's property.


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Final#6406
Sora is a halfy


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] unused account#5547
no idea gemmy! which do you prefer?


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Shadow.#4781
You're not any gender, you're a country


[23-Sep-18 10:04 AM] Final#6406
if square wants to use him they have to ask disney and vice versa for disney

[23-Sep-18 10:27 AM] Final#6406

[23-Sep-18 10:27 AM] Caifabe#0887
No. But death metal is pretty good.


[23-Sep-18 10:27 AM] Shadow.#4781
No sorry


[23-Sep-18 10:29 AM] Caifabe#0887
With emo I was thinking more along the lines of Taking Back Sunday, Silverstein, Saosin, The Used, Finch, My Chemical Romance, Alexisonfire, Paramore, etc

Because


[23-Sep-18 10:36 AM] Final#6406

*shoulderpat*


[23-Sep-18 10:51 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
@Final#6406 also just cuz disney owns sora means nothing
in all honesty its free advertising for kindom hearts
which helps disney
*shrugs*


[23-Sep-18 10:51 AM] Final#6406
i realized that when i thought of WOFF


[23-Sep-18 10:51 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Also the same could be said for shadow
The reason sega is SUDDENLY pushing him
so hard


[23-Sep-18 10:51 AM] James™#1747
🤔


[23-Sep-18 10:51 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
12 years ago he was playable
12
Now hes playable as dlc
in sonic forces


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Guts#4487
What are you talking about?


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and in team sonic racing


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Guts#4487
Oh


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
He's in the trailer SO MUCH


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Final#6406
Shadow is gonna be in the game


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
so sega is clearly trying their best to advertise shadow


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Guts#4487
He appeared in Sonic adventure 2, huh?
First time


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Final#6406
pfffft knuckles being in the game


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and my guess is because hes gonna be in smash
cuz like
Knuckles's popular
but shadow?
Shadow is like


[23-Sep-18 10:52 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Chaos control


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
the only reason half of the sonic fans watch/play lately


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Guts#4487
Chaos spear


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
unless its sonic mania
the minute you say "shadow's in the game"
peple are like


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Final#6406

[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Guts#4487
I'm playing Adventure 2


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
*~~with like 7 stages~~*
but still
it works for advertising


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Guts#4487
On a Dreamcast emulator


[23-Sep-18 10:53 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 10:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
but yea like
Knuckles is cool and all
and memey
but
Shadow?
Might as well change Sonic the Hedgehog to Sonic and Shadow
becuase like
thats how every modern sonic fan wants it done


[23-Sep-18 10:55 AM] Guts#4487
Hm.


[23-Sep-18 10:55 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Isabelle is such a stupid choice imo


[23-Sep-18 10:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 10:55 AM] James™#1747

Calm down @🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736


[23-Sep-18 10:57 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

Sonic battle is where sonic got his moves too tho

[23-Sep-18 10:57 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Half of sonics physical attacks?
are from sonic battle
but
they're taken
from SHADOW.
not sonic himself


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
Meaning shadow echo fighter


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Guts#4487
...


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

I mean look at Chrome


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Chrom has no uniqueness


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
his moveset is different from roy's


[23-Sep-18 10:58 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
he's just

[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
The roster has been made already


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
like most of the characters were being developped


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] Guts#4487
I like sonic


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
they're just revealing every month


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
before the game


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] Guts#4487
But i prefer shadow


[23-Sep-18 10:59 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] Final#6406
we did get a leak of the final 3 characters apparently


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] Final#6406
by the same person who got issabelle right


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
who are the final 3 ]


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
there's not going to be a final 3


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
apparently


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Its going to be more.
vergeben is the one who got them right first off
and he only has 7 of the 13 he predicted in the game so far
which means if we go by just vergeben


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] Final#6406
its gonna be ken from SF, A 7th gen pokemon and a square rep


[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

[23-Sep-18 11:00 AM] Final#6406

[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Guts#4487
Your debate is useless


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
about another leak?
Is correct


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Guts#4487
Shut it.


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Final#6406
uhhhh
hate to be that guy


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and that they have both have the same info
but different sources
and that he has something they dont, they have something he doesnt
Vergeben said there's a minecraft related item but he doesnt know what


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] Final#6406
remember the sm4sh leaks


[23-Sep-18 11:02 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
he talked to the other leaker
and guess what
he literally has the same info
but a different source
and the info is slightly more revealing
and it makes sense
but
im gonna cry
we might get steve in smash if they dont change their minds
***killmenow***


[23-Sep-18 11:03 AM] Raishin#2140
Steve?

[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Raishin#2140
He’d look so out of place


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Not even joking


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Raishin#2140

[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Final#6406
not only is your online service garbage but steve


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Caifabe#0887
I posted a selfie if anyone wants to check it out or something idk do what you want I'm just sayin.


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Honestly its not hard to make him fit in


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Raishin#2140
Unless he looked like a mii character


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
we have terrible mii fighters
we have 2d fighters
flat fighters


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Raishin#2140
Ew


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] James™#1747
Steve in smash bro's? 😂


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
it really doesnt matter at this point


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] James™#1747
oh gosh


[23-Sep-18 11:04 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 11:05 AM] James™#1747
how is that gonna work, thats so weird
xd


[23-Sep-18 11:05 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Im hoping that nintendo scraps it


[23-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Final#6406
At this point Sora could be in


[23-Sep-18 11:05 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
even as dlc
pls no


[23-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Raishin#2140
What is Nintendo thinking, adding *steve* in


[23-Sep-18 11:06 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
I mean
its smart as a buisness move
think about it for a sec
remember the e3 garbage
about minecraft being on the switch?
and cross compatibility with xbox?


[23-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah


[23-Sep-18 11:06 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
They were advertising SPECIFICALLY minecraft at first
why?


[23-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Final#6406
i see where you're coming from but....


[23-Sep-18 11:06 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Because they view it as important
unfortunately
so its not that farfetched
infact


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Final#6406
i mean


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
here's the thing that i like about smash


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Final#6406
villager is in the game


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
They dont have rules.
They dont


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Final#6406
so anything could happen


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
when you break down the LEGIT rules of characters in smash


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Raishin#2140
True


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
the only thing is
"have to be in a video game character"
"have to be important to your series in some way"


[23-Sep-18 11:07 AM] Raishin#2140
Makes sense


[23-Sep-18 11:08 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
"have to be somehow iconic to gaming (for newcomers)"
Daisy in and out of herself might not be iconic to gaming
but as an echo of peach, idk if she really has to be
Meanwhile Isabelle


[23-Sep-18 11:08 AM] Final#6406
she could have just stated an alt costume for peach


[23-Sep-18 11:08 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
is arguably the most popular character in animal crossing
putting her in smash and announcing animal crossing 2019?
not that bad
There are other people talking astral
so its not just a rant
just because you dont enjoy it doesnt mean we have to move, however you could always ask


[23-Sep-18 11:09 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I mean Astral does have a point.


[23-Sep-18 11:09 AM] Raishin#2140
Oh you have got to be shitting me rn


[23-Sep-18 11:09 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and we could end it
right right


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
I made a #video-games channel now


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Anyways Final
Nice conversation
we'll never have it again
but


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] Final#6406
Astral is right tho it is a bit too intense


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
It was nice
dm me sometime maybe


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] ChocoPudding#9452
If y'all want to continue there's #video-games


[23-Sep-18 11:10 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
No thanks. i'm done talking for tonight.
Probably the week


[23-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Raishin#2140
My closet door is broken ;-;


[23-Sep-18 11:11 AM] ChocoPudding#9452

[23-Sep-18 11:11 AM] Raishin#2140

Take care


[23-Sep-18 11:13 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
No
you could just
ignore it like others
or just next time you see us talking about something you dont like
say
"hey"
"could you change the topic?"
that there was too much
well i hate to be that person but
ANYTHING i talk about?
there's gonna be "too much"
because i talk alot.


[23-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Final#6406
Astral has the right to say that though


[23-Sep-18 11:14 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Yes
He can say it
he can even ask us to stop
but he didnt
thats why im a lil upset
but whtever.
let's not continue garbage drama


[23-Sep-18 11:14 AM] Raishin#2140

you gotta think positive


[23-Sep-18 11:15 AM] Raishin#2140
Until ur whole family line is just trash cans and dumpsters


[23-Sep-18 11:15 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
to be garbage you have to physically be worse than anyone else
*~~so me~~*


[23-Sep-18 11:15 AM] James™#1747
@🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736 You can use some caps just dont use it too much alright?


[23-Sep-18 11:16 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
but the point is is
that's not you
you might be a little terrible if you think so
But not garbage
Ok?


[23-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Final#6406
I know someone thats worse than garbage, Astral thats not you man

Uh

[23-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Raishin#2140
You can’t be garbage unless ur whole ancestry comes from dumpsters, alright?


[23-Sep-18 11:16 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
worthless is better than garbage
you're still a human


[23-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Final#6406
everyone is worth something

its a win lose scenario


[23-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Raishin#2140

@Final#6406
Somebody who leaked smash 4 stuff successfully leaked some stuff for smash ulti, dm me for details lmao @Final#6406


[23-Sep-18 11:25 AM] Final#6406
o that waen't what i was saying i just said that for an example


[23-Sep-18 11:26 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
*one of the characters is extremely possible but extremely unlikely*


[23-Sep-18 11:26 AM] Final#6406
lets just hope nobody leaks the entire game like what happened 4 years ago


[23-Sep-18 11:26 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Yea honestly
i kinda wanna buy it
@Final#6406 He leaked everything in both directs before they showed up
Apparently he also leaked Issac, Black Shadow, Ken, Skull kid, Medusa, Ayumi, Ninten, And ((Reimu))


[23-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Final#6406
Ninten


[23-Sep-18 11:28 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
***reimu is weird but its actually very possible***


[23-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Final#6406
like we need another earthbound/mother rep that looks the exact same as Gorde- i mean death scy- i mean ness with a death scyth

Right right
we'll stop there
forever.
No im just saying
99% of what i talk about is videogames
and i dont wnat to leave general just to talk
i'd rather be where anyone can talk about anything


[23-Sep-18 11:30 AM] uRite1#0061
Hey everyone I'm bored


[23-Sep-18 11:30 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
so i just wont talk about video games i guess
*shrug*
and dont are you kidding me with this, pretty sure you've been venting about stuff and then some in general
when there's a #rant-venting
oops
*shrugs* give it 10 minutes all you want
im here to find likeminded people
yes there is
talk about it
Type
in venting
too bad?
so is not warning people
what happens here happens
Adapt/work around it
cuz it doesnt matter in the end
back to good topics
the sky was orange yesterday
@Final#6406
@Raishin#2140 help, lets get a good convo started again lmao


[23-Sep-18 11:35 AM] Raishin#2140
Ok
The weather here isn’t so nice


[23-Sep-18 11:36 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
oooff
why not?


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] Raishin#2140
It’s cloudy
And grey


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
oof fair
im listening to Additional Memory by JIN


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] Raishin#2140
Never heard


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
ofc you haven't


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] Raishin#2140
Oof


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
its a vocaloidish song


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] Raishin#2140
Meaning?


[23-Sep-18 11:37 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Vocaloid
its like
robotic singers


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Raishin#2140
Ohh


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
but the song is actually made by people


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
I'm not a fan of vocaloid.


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
I wish someone had a good cover of this song
but
it just came out


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Final#6406
they're ok


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
I'm more of a punk/rock/emo/hardcore/metal guy.


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Raishin#2140
Give it a day


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
I know
you said that
You know that vocaloid is a sub genre right?
there's vocaloid of all those
x3


[23-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Caifabe#0887
Yeah, I know. I just don't really like vocaloid anything.


[23-Sep-18 11:39 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and then there's just plan japanese versions of all those genres
plain*


[23-Sep-18 11:39 AM] Caifabe#0887
I'd rather hear an actual voice instead of a robot.
And I love Japanese rock music


[23-Sep-18 11:39 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Same
but
how do i explain this
If you're really good at making music and lyrics
but your voice sucks
and you cant hire someone
vocaloid helps push it a bit


[23-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Caifabe#0887
I guess, yeah.


[23-Sep-18 11:40 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and then other people will cover it and boom its better
Somepeople like me love songs, and go back to the original like
oof


[23-Sep-18 11:40 AM] Caifabe#0887
I've been obsessed with this band called The Used lately.


[23-Sep-18 11:40 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
improvemnt for sure
and hwat happens is
those vocaloid artists
eventually work on their own stuff
and suddenly you have kickass music
and better voices
same thing for the cover artists
they usually end up making their own songs
Like MafuMafu
No
Night core is taking a song
and speeeding it up
making it higher pitch
and thats it


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Raishin#2140
True


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Caifabe#0887
I really don't like nightcore.


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Raishin#2140
It sounds so annoying


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
That just means you dont like the song tho


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Final#6406
nightcore isnt good


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
If the way you like it better is changing how its designed
then you dont like the song
You like the sounds


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Caifabe#0887
I do sometimes like pitching songs up to chipmunk range to hear how they would sound.


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
The theme/speed, tempo all hat


[23-Sep-18 11:42 AM] Raishin#2140
I don’t understand how people can remix sons that don’t have lyrics

*songs


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Songs arent just lyrics


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah ik


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
the music is there to fit the song
not talking about you one
x3


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Raishin#2140
Ohh
Sowwy


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
its very easy in concept to remix songs without lyrics
but
The execution is
very
Very difficult
sometimes it works


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Raishin#2140
Yeah


[23-Sep-18 11:43 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
sometimes it doesnt
for example
I like "Demetori Wind god girl"
as a remix


[23-Sep-18 11:44 AM] Caifabe#0887
As a composer I like to write music that fits with the lyrics I'm writing. Or if I have music that I like but don't have lyrics written yet I like to write lyrics that fit the mood and atmosphere of the music. When someone takes that and pitches it up to nightcore I find it insulting to the original creation.


[23-Sep-18 11:44 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
there's no lyrics
its just music
its actually a remix
of touhou "wind god girl
and if you listen to both
You will realize
there is A VAST difference
and it is done in a way that makes a unique enhanced version of the song
and not a ruined mess without anything similar
or just a different sound
The original has like
a very chill flow


[23-Sep-18 11:45 AM] Caifabe#0887
It's different where it's an actual remix and not nightcore, because with a remix you're taking bits and pieces of the song and chopping and mixing them up, while nightcore is literally just changing the pitch and speed of the original song without putting any creativity into it.


[23-Sep-18 11:45 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
jazzy beat
stuff like that
its very mellow
the remix
makes it sound like
the earths gonna fucking explode
if you dont beat the boss
not really because that is literally the definition of nightcore?
You're probably thinking of the wrong thing then
also
do me a favour
Aya's Theme - Wind God Girl
listen to that first
No
its just nightcore
OF a remix
and then


[23-Sep-18 11:47 AM] Caifabe#0887
If there's a nightcore version of a song that has actually been REMIXED BY THE NIGHTCORE EDITOR then I'll give that a chance.


[23-Sep-18 11:47 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
after you listen to that
listen to this
Demetori - 風神少女 (Wind God Girl)
Same source material but
VASTLY different
in a good way
no. what he means is
If the guy remixed the song on his own perfectly, and its already good, THEN added night core
then its good
but there's 0 People who do that
so far
especially any good ones


[23-Sep-18 11:48 AM] Caifabe#0887
Hit it right on the head @🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736


[23-Sep-18 11:48 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Of course i did
.....
Uh
Astral


[23-Sep-18 11:49 AM] Raishin#2140
What


[23-Sep-18 11:49 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
The definition of night core is speeding something up
and pitching it higher
if you have nothing to speed up or pitch higher
how is it night core?
***think for a sec***
***real hard***
***THATS N-***
***that's not. the same thing..***


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Raishin#2140
Oh nuuu


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Caifabe#0887
Autotune can be used in very creative ways. But that's not nightcore.


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
***it's not called night core...its called autotune...***
but like
@Raishin#2140
do me a favour
Aya's Theme - Wind God Girl
Demetori - 風神少女 (Wind God Girl)
listen to these things
Ok
it's wrong


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Raishin#2140
Ok


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
but you're free to believe it
❤


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Caifabe#0887
And I'm not trying to change your mind Astral, I'm just saying what I know is true.


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
uh ok
thats uncalled for
but cool


[23-Sep-18 11:50 AM] Final#6406
autotune and nightcore are 2 different things astral


[23-Sep-18 11:51 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
We're not saying you cant like it
but
by definition
its not night core
sorry?
@Raishin#2140 Tell me what kind of vibe you get from the first song
then tell me what the second song feels like as opposed
We're not
we're saying
right now
Night core
Is night core
Eg
Sped up
Higher pitched
Songs


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Raishin#2140
Should I listen to the whole thing?


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Uhhh just like
2 min


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Raishin#2140
Ok


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] !♡ DM 2 PARTNER#9628
Woah


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
And what you've described about the song you like
makes it seem like it's not night core
or atleast not only nightcore
.Ok now i understand
that's not a remix hun
That's additive


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] Caifabe#0887
Then it's not nightcore.


[23-Sep-18 11:52 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
That's creative liberties
Doing whatever you want to it
If it was the tune a little different sure, but what you're thinking of is an additive cover
a nightcore additive cover


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Caifabe#0887
By the way, I find it funny how Keisa and I are being very adamant about our point while still being respectful about it, and Astral's just out here refusing to acknowledge our points and being disrespectful.


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
????????????????????????????????????????????????


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Caifabe#0887
D00D NIGHTCORE IS NOT A GENRE


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Wait
no no
it is
but
"ITS OWN"
it's literally
editing
other music


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] Raishin#2140
@🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736 Aya’s theme is better imo


[23-Sep-18 11:54 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
IT is but
What's different
What kinda scenario did you get from the first one?


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Caifabe#0887
It's taking other people's music and editing its pitch and speed.


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
For me it felt like, some sort of ceremony


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Raishin#2140
I just got like a pretty chill adventure sorta thing. Or like traveling and first starting a battle


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Like laying food down on the table
setting the chairs.


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Caifabe#0887
If nightcore was actually creative I'd like it.


[23-Sep-18 11:55 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Watching the mountains
etc
the second one sounds like
a nukes going off and you better fucking RUN


[23-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Raishin#2140
The second one seemed like as if I was gonna fight the overlord or some shit and the whole world depended on me winning the battle


[23-Sep-18 11:56 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
YEA
SEE
THATS A GOOD REMIX
THE SAME SONG. but DIFFERENT TONE.
It creates another point of Perspective!
Some remixes


[23-Sep-18 11:56 AM] Raishin#2140
Remember don’t use a lotta caps


[23-Sep-18 11:56 AM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Just change the sounds
and thats ok too
because sometimes that helps the tone as well
but like
my favourite remixes are when you can listen to it
be like super cool
and then listen to the original
be like
super chill
and vice versa
and have someone go
"thats the remix of the same song"
and go
"WAIT Really!?"


[23-Sep-18 11:57 AM] James™#1747
wats going on here?


[23-Sep-18 11:57 AM] Raishin#2140

and ofc all she wants to do is die
or tell him that she loves him

Time loops are fucking great when done correctly
eg not a story that's supposed to continue onwards


[23-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Final#6406
i like time loops


[23-Sep-18 12:08 PM] Raishin#2140
I like cake


[23-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Gribble#0323
im pretty dumb so if there's a plot hole  in a time loop i usually dont notice


[23-Sep-18 12:09 PM] Final#6406
Kingdom Hearts taught me to spot plot holes in time loops


[23-Sep-18 12:09 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
THere really isnt any plot hole
trust me
its
Crazy good
Because the plot is simple and not complicated in a way
basically its


[23-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Gribble#0323
what are we talking about?
first of all


[23-Sep-18 12:10 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
The time loop started once on August 13
once it started
it repeats August 13-15 everytime
BUT
the characters, atleast one of them somehow makes different choices


[23-Sep-18 12:10 PM] Gribble#0323
majoras mask
cool


[23-Sep-18 12:10 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
so its always different
not really
Majora's mask is about being dead and coping with it lmao

Yeah like there's a moon falling down


[23-Sep-18 12:11 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
This is about an angry snake that was cheated out of eternal youth
***i kid you not***
then he possesses a kid, kills all of them
and the reason time loops is


[23-Sep-18 12:11 PM] Final#6406
im sold already


[23-Sep-18 12:11 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
The one that does it is there friend
and keeps repeating time so they wont die
OH SHIT
I FORGOT
the villain causes things to be different everytime!
He makes the character who reset time, so desperate that she gives some power to the protag, and then he doesnt treat things like other timelines, but dreams that have been happening
so for him its like inception
every time he wakes up


[23-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Final#6406
anime sounds interesting but hows the art direction


[23-Sep-18 12:13 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

I'm passionate about anything i like lol
but its so cool
Cuz you have this main character with no knowledge except some dreams


[23-Sep-18 12:13 PM] Gribble#0323
i can only think of one thing i like that i have that level of passion for, must be nice


[23-Sep-18 12:14 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
try to save everyone who he thinks isnt really his friend (he doesnt know anything in his dreams actually happened)
and the VILLAIN
randomly interrupts it everytime
something goes wrong
"Oops he didnt make it to the mall, I'll just go there and shoot them all up."
*there's literally a fucked up scene in the manga where he just decides* "Shit one of the experiments didnt work this timeline, welp, time to go massacre those kids."

He literally holds a gun to the kids head

[23-Sep-18 12:18 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
The soundtrack was way before the anime
the anime came only BECAUSE the soundtrack spawned manga
and even then
The anime, Music Videos, and Manga all talk about different timelines
and you need every piece to understand what anything is
Also the song you're talking about is the song that ***i kid you not***
was the 3rd song this man had reach the top of nico nico charts in a row
This man outshined his own best work 3 times
with no other song competing

xenoblade can be strange to get your head around too


[23-Sep-18 12:23 PM] i_miss_my_mom_happy_september26#6123
Hm


[23-Sep-18 12:23 PM] Final#6406
xenoblade 2 is trasg


[23-Sep-18 12:23 PM] Gribble#0323
it's a fine game, but the legacy that was 1 is dissapointing
except i prefer the soundtrack in 2


[23-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Final#6406
xenoblade 1 is one of my favorite games of all time behind FFIX


[23-Sep-18 12:24 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
We learn that he was created. By his sister. who... was a god? but not a god?! And In the PAST?! she created him in the future!? and then he went to the past, becoming the black beast, which gave him enough presence to keep existing, and due to time rules, he suddenly existed since the beginning, making it possible for his sister to create him, and then HE goes to this giant machine and says "ERASE ALL OF ME FROM EXISTENCE"


[23-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Gribble#0323
xenoblade 1 is my favourite game of all time
jesus
there's probably a plot hole in that paragraph


[23-Sep-18 12:25 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
there is unless you consider Blazblue exists by being a plothole
that is the plot
They ruin time and space each game with things called "Phenomena interventions"


[23-Sep-18 12:25 PM] Final#6406
i mean


[23-Sep-18 12:25 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
and then oof new story, new things to learn
But somehow


[23-Sep-18 12:25 PM] Final#6406
could the entire persona series be a plothole to SMT


[23-Sep-18 12:25 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
they manage to make it all make sense
no
Alternate timeline sure
but not a plot hole
hell actually might be an alternate dimension
and as for danganronpa
Do me a favour and answer me a question
Izuru. Do you think he intended on helping junko, and changed his mind?


[23-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Final#6406
wasent he just doing his own thing


[23-Sep-18 12:27 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Mhm, but why?
I'll tell you why
He's izuru.
He knew. The minute he was created.
He knew.
EVERYTHING.
that was going to happen.


[23-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Final#6406
but still had the memories of hajime


[23-Sep-18 12:27 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
No
he didnt
he knew about everything
he knew HE USED to be hajime


[23-Sep-18 12:28 PM] Gribble#0323
remind me, izuru is like edgy hajime right?
yeh okay


[23-Sep-18 12:28 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
but he also knew he couldn't ever truly be hajime
so he played along with junko
let everything happen in such away that she would destroy herself
Then what he did
was he created the junko virus thing
and uploaded it
Its even specifically stated that A. Junko didnt expect herself to fail in the first game
B. She didnt make any back up plans.
Now my question is why would he have done any of this?
Do you know why?


[23-Sep-18 12:29 PM] Gribble#0323
because the despair arc is  a mess
?


[23-Sep-18 12:29 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
He knew he couldnt do it.
In order to get hajime back to his full potential, he had to endure the torture of that simulation gone wrong
He also knew that if hajime came out perfect, but the rest didnt, it wouldn't go well for the final showdown with the future foundation.
despair arc?
We're talking about DR2
He knew that if he left everything the way it was


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] unused account#5547
O3O


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
didnt use his ability to plan all this
and everything
that Ryota
Would've literally released that animation to the world
and everything would've been fucked


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] Raishin#2140
Wait what danganronpa game are you talking about?


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

Oh ok


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736
Why would a guy like izuru
care about any of that?
The answer is simple


[23-Sep-18 12:31 PM] unused account#5547
can i say a danganronpa thing


[23-Sep-18 12:32 PM] 🖌🌺~Cuddly Keikei~🌺🖌#6736

[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Dats an istant ban


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gribble#0323
i just read it


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Caifabe#0887
Suicide jokes aren't allowed.
Instaban


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Instant*


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gribble#0323
banter isnt allowed then i guess


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Caifabe#0887
I probably should have warned her about that.


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] Gribble#0323
am i gonna get banned for saying that


[23-Sep-18 02:22 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Just not suicide jokes.
She could've read the rules,


[23-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Caifabe#0887
I'm trying to stay civil here and make sure nothing bad happens.


[23-Sep-18 02:23 PM] Raishin#2140
That’s my job


[23-Sep-18 02:23 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
You can disagree.
It was not a mistake.
She purposefully did it.
No suicide jokes are allowed.
It's an instant ban.
I say for the third time.


[23-Sep-18 02:24 PM] Berry's prince#4765
She was already disrepecting staff too so


[23-Sep-18 02:24 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
It's. An. Instant. Ban.
Other people, friends, haven't gotten second chances.


[23-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Gribble#0323
it's whatever man just leave it alone
he was doing his job


[23-Sep-18 02:25 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
I'm a girl.


[23-Sep-18 02:25 PM] Raishin#2140

[23-Sep-18 02:26 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Lmao.
Look.
She can appeal it if she wants.
But I did my job.


[23-Sep-18 02:26 PM] Gribble#0323
let's all calm down and have some uwu time


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
If you wish to complain. @Em 🥀#0323 @Sleepie ♥#3301 @Lily#1606 talk to them
I don't make the rules.
I simply enforce them.


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Lily#1606
I didn't either I only offered some


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] big toe#0019
What happened here?


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Lily#1606
Also you're madmin berry


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Context Lilith, I banned someone for suicide joke.


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Lily#1606
owo
Oof
That just isn't allowed


[23-Sep-18 02:27 PM] Gribble#0323
ah the legendary emma is online


[23-Sep-18 02:28 PM] Lily#1606
Anyone wanting to argue it will be punished
Thank you


[23-Sep-18 02:28 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
It was an emoji with a gun to their head.
Idk man


[23-Sep-18 02:29 PM] big toe#0019
How is that a suicide joke tho? I'm just asking. I wouldn't ban someone over emojis, but if she/he said "I want to kill myself 😄 🔫" I would ban.


[23-Sep-18 02:30 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Well I did, so. Lmao.
And they were already causing issues soo.


[23-Sep-18 02:30 PM] Gribble#0323
that's it, youve annoyed me for the last time *shows claws and growls*


[23-Sep-18 02:30 PM] big toe#0019
Also, nowhere in the rules does it say "suicide jokes aren't allowed" 
It isn't allowed to tell someone to kill themselves.


[23-Sep-18 02:31 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Lilith, my superior, just said "it isn't allowed"
So idk why you're arguing with me
They also said anyone arguing it will get punished.
So drop it.


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Em 🥀#0323
So someone seems to have something wrong with the rules?


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] big toe#0019
She didn't break any rules, that's my issue with all of this.


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Em 🥀#0323
The rules clearly state rule 17


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
I do not make the rules of my god.
oh*
Arguing with ***me***


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] Gribble#0323
we got the final boss in the chat 👀


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] big toe#0019
She didn't suggest to anyone that they should kill themselves.


[23-Sep-18 02:33 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Doesn't get anything done


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] big toe#0019
She didn't ping anyone, she didn't say anything before it.


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Yikes it should be common sense that suicide jokes in general aren't allowed.


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Em 🥀#0323
“Do not suggest another member harm themselves this is an instant ban”
17


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] big toe#0019
Where did she suggest that someone should harm themselves?


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Em 🥀#0323
any form of tellin ANYONE to “Kys” “Die” is an instant ban


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] big toe#0019
She sent " 😃 🔫"


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Gribble#0323
this just seems like arguing for the sake of arguing


[23-Sep-18 02:34 PM] Em 🥀#0323
@ChocoPudding#9452 what was said?
Was it just those emojis?


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] big toe#0019
yes.


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Em 🥀#0323
Loli is this true?


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
Yes, in my opinion that's commonly used as a suicide joke
With no context


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Em 🥀#0323
No, that legit means I wanna die


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Berry's prince#4765
She was also disrespecting staff just as a btw


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
^^^


[23-Sep-18 02:35 PM] Em 🥀#0323
What was she saying about staff?


[23-Sep-18 02:36 PM] big toe#0019
What thing?


[23-Sep-18 02:36 PM] ChocoPudding#9452
No I banned her for what I perceived as a suicide joke
So you're saying
She posted she wanted to kill herself
because I was showing affection
to my bf
LMAO

Question: What games do you guys want to see on the PlayStation Classic when it comes out?
It's a mini-PS1, Tony.


[23-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Lily#1606
oh yeah
GTA 7
kek


[23-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Caifabe#0887

[23-Sep-18 04:59 PM] Caifabe#0887
GTA 42069
But getting away from shitposting real quick, let's be serious on this


[23-Sep-18 05:00 PM] Caifabe#0887
So far, Final Fantasy VII, Wild Arms, Ridge Racer Type 4, Jumping Flash, and Tekken 3 have all been announced.
As for my predictions on what else will make it in, well, it's going to have 20 games so...


[23-Sep-18 05:03 PM] Raishin#2140
What’s gonna have 20 games?


[23-Sep-18 05:03 PM] Caifabe#0887
I'm gonna say Metal Gear Solid for sure, Chrono Cross has a good chance of getting in, Crash Team Racing, the original Grand Theft Auto...
PlayStation Classic


[23-Sep-18 05:04 PM] Shadow.#4781
Thanos car?
