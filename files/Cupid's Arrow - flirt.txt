Ive never been judged before for giving hugs


[22-Sep-18 04:35 AM] Guts#4487
I don't want to fight with you
Let's just restart everything
I don't want to be on bad terms with you
'cause you seems to be a kind guy
Hm.
So.
I'm sorry for calling you perv
There's nothing wrong with giving hugs
Happy now?


[22-Sep-18 04:38 AM] Berry's prince#4765
its just the way you responded to him giving hugs seemed very hostile but ok


[22-Sep-18 04:39 AM] Guts#4487
'kay
I just sound like that
There's nothing against anyone


[22-Sep-18 04:53 AM] James‚Ñ¢#1747

[22-Sep-18 05:29 AM] üñ§Lunaüñ§#5936
Hello
How are you
Im@good, half alseep still üòÇ
Mhm hehe
Mhmm....You have to be very careful, don‚Äôt do that it‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me thing. Be honest but gentle. Take it slow and always comfort them
I know sweetie and I‚Äôm sorry. I wish the first person you meet was that one but sadly the world likes to challenge us
I know, the world can be a very Messed up place.... but there is beauty in everything. Even the darkest moments have light
I know where I stand. Life has no been easy for me. I know that you can lose side of hope and many bad things can happen all at once.... but I still try to see the positive... everyone is a person with emotions and feelings. No one has it easy in life so I try to help as much as I can. I a really been passion I have.


[22-Sep-18 05:48 AM] James‚Ñ¢#1747
I'm bad at relationships as well. All my relationships i've had doesnt last 2 weeks without me saying something dumb or i get too jealous or something. it's the worst. I basically hurt myself being in relationships.
Which is why im taking it easy and not exactly looking.
Reason im bad at relationships is because im a bad boyfriend. Because of my anxiety, it kinda blows everything i want away.


[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Guts#4487
I never loved anyone.


[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] James‚Ñ¢#1747
So, instead of trying to find the woman i love, i try to help others with advice and stuff.


[22-Sep-18 05:49 AM] Guts#4487
=_=


[22-Sep-18 05:50 AM] James‚Ñ¢#1747
i try to be supportive, kind and caring.

@hellman007#5676 breakups are the worst. it's literally destroyed me.


[22-Sep-18 05:51 AM] unused account#5547
aw well i guess you just have to wait until the right person is found!


[22-Sep-18 05:52 AM] James‚Ñ¢#1747
Or just stay single for the rest of my life *shrugs* xd


[22-Sep-18 05:52 AM] unused account#5547
it doesnt mean literally not looking for someone
ive been with 7 or 8 exes so far not including the complicated ones and trust me it really isnt easy to find someone perfect for you
and sometimes even when you find someone you think is perfect for you they just dont like you back
you should never let your past heartbreak stop you from finding someone to put your heart back together
dont stay hung up on memories of people who hurt you!! instead, look for someone else who's better for you
distance is only a barrier for those who make it one
i guess it depends on how much youre willing to sacrifice for the person you love!
i had an online gf and someone asked her out irl, and although she felt attraction for him she turned him down for me
she could have had hugs and cuddles and everything i couldnt provide at long distance!! but thats not how love works i guess
i dont know, i wouldnt love someone for what they give me, id love them for themself
so even if it seems impossible the only person to put those barriers is the people themself! if they dont want to date someone cause theres a distance then that was their choice, and yet there are people who love others enough to wait until they can finally meet, even if it takes years
oo golly i really shouldnt be typin so much
sorry!! i wasnt referring to anyone specific, just in general

adjective

[22-Sep-18 05:38 PM] Orbitus#5636
You can't not get rejected btw

[22-Sep-18 05:39 PM] Orbitus#5636
Heh
That doesn't mean you should become desperate
Once you meet a person that resonates, then persue them
Don't just be like ***"HAVE MAI BEBBEHS"***


[22-Sep-18 05:40 PM] Andromeda#8585

[22-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Andromeda#8585
love is a game true
but when you in a relationship it isnt a game on that time


[22-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Orbitus#5636
No, love is a commitment that you dedicate yourself to


[22-Sep-18 05:42 PM] Andromeda#8585
yeah
thats what i meant


[22-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Orbitus#5636
And in that can grow and blossom into one of the most beautiful things that you could ever imagine


[22-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Andromeda#8585
yeah


[22-Sep-18 05:43 PM] Orbitus#5636
And sometimes beyond what you could imagine


[22-Sep-18 05:44 PM] Andromeda#8585
imagination is a unlimited space and time
anybody would go there
bruh im so high


[22-Sep-18 05:45 PM] Orbitus#5636

[22-Sep-18 08:03 PM] Orbitus#5636
So, I have this poem from a while ago about The Great Gatsby, but it can work for other people too I guess. 
Nervous is the man whom owns the world,

Till love comes to pass and all is unfurled,

All heart and no mind as the lovers walk unyielding,

Their journey through the world soon to be fulfilling,

Departing through the broken and cold,

They trod the untrodden forever whilst peeking,

At which the world offers to hold,

And all they have been seeking,

Striding down the path of fate,

Two lovers shall never separate,

Till the hands of God tear them asunder,

They shall never seek another lover,

At the tendrils of time one shall fall,

But soon they shall be reunited, after all.
Sorry.

Lol, it's a simple poem, it's fine. Don't worry about it, Elf.


[22-Sep-18 08:07 PM] Andromeda#8585
simple as it is powerfull
it could reach others
We‚Äôre just Romeo and Juliet

But getting drunk and eating Percocets

But just to ease the stress

But soft what light, thru yonder window breaks

It is the east, but Juliet just puked off the balcony
How romantic
