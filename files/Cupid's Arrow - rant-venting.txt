_ranting_


[17-Sep-18 05:23 PM] Em ü•Ä#0323
And you breaking hearts like that's your only talent üôÑ


[17-Sep-18 06:17 PM] Marki#6105
well
I might be the first person to actually use this
Well.. I can't lie.  Two years ago I lost a best friend to a car crash.. I had a very rough time getting around it, he was my second best friend, if my first hadn't been around I most likely would have gone down a very dark path.. About a year ago.. I met a girl her name is Sara. And is now my best friend. I talk to her daily and we tell each other **everything**. Recently I had gone through a rough patch with her because of her now ex.. I because so heart broken to see her this depressed. Now she's got a new gf and she's amazing they've been together a few months now but.. I don't know. I just don't feel.. Happy I've helped so many people through their depression. Now it's my turn and I don't know what to do. ugh why am I ranting here. No one probably cares. ugh.


[17-Sep-18 10:28 PM] Jess#8717
I can't lie anymore. Over the past few days, I have been so stressed. Here's the problem. No one even cares to ask why I'm stressed anymore. And it sucks.


[17-Sep-18 10:28 PM] Brandon#4581
Why are you stressed?


[17-Sep-18 10:28 PM] Jess#8717
I'm not exactly sure, but I know something that occured last November was one of many contributing factors.


[17-Sep-18 10:29 PM] Brandon#4581
And what was that?


[17-Sep-18 10:32 PM] Jess#8717
Well, I got bullied pretty badly by someone who I can't mention here, as I do not want to cause any more drama between him and I. That's personal. However, he still dislikes me so much. I did something wrong. And I guess I have to pay the price. That's why it's so hard for me to invest myself emotionally, even now.


[17-Sep-18 10:34 PM] Thoza#0001
"Paying the price" isn't something you have to do, you got bullied so why does that mean you have to have the problem put on you when you never asked to be treated as you have been, its a struggle climbing from what happened as personally I have been there but I bet if I got to know you more Jess you are probably a great person and have so much to you that tht person who bullied you totally missed from, if you ever are feeling that stressed or feeling anyway down u can always message me and I will ask you why you are stressed & hopefully brighten ur mood, talk? or even play games or whatever!!! ‚ù§ üíå @Jess#8717


[18-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Lily#1606

It's nothing Brandon. I was mad cause of a game


[21-Sep-18 06:49 AM] Lily#1606
If my bf doesn't respond by the end of the day I'm fucking done with him because honestly I don't need the stress anymore of wondering if he still loves me or if he's alive or any of that fucking shit


[21-Sep-18 06:51 AM] NEP#3199
Hey, Lilith how long has it been scence he last responded? Cause you must take in the possibility that he physically can‚Äôt respond right now


[21-Sep-18 08:17 AM] Lily#1606
It's been over a week and I've been questioning whether I still have feelings for a while and it isn't fair to either of us


[21-Sep-18 08:18 AM] Orbital#5826
Honestly if he hasnt replied in a week, he's most likely ignoring you or doesnt care. if he cared enough he would find a way to getin contact


[21-Sep-18 08:41 AM] Lily#1606
The thing is they live in a kinda oppressive household but this lack of communication is a little too long so my anxiety kicked in but it's unhealthy for me and that's one of the main reasons I don't think I even love him anynore
He has until 7pm CST
So like 11 hours
Er 10


[21-Sep-18 09:24 AM] Orbital#5826
THAts fair


[21-Sep-18 09:36 AM] Pacheco#3651
@Lily#1606 I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôre going through that, just know that others know how it feels. I‚Äôve been through that too and I hope it works out well for you, if you need anyone to talk to in private you can talk to me. Cheers Lilith


[21-Sep-18 10:06 AM] Lily#1606

[21-Sep-18 09:13 PM] totally not klop#0411
Why is 2018 so fucking stupid


[21-Sep-18 10:17 PM] Orbital#5826
Because everyone is a degenerate


[21-Sep-18 10:32 PM] totally not klop#0411
That and because idiots of this generation have to have a title on everything
No im not bisexual im pan
No im not a girl or a boy im gender fluis
Fluid*
i mean be what u want bro but fucking ay dont get mad at someone cuz they dont fucking know what you are right off the fucking gate
And on that note where the fuck did all these terms come from
And why the fuck are they actually taken serious


[22-Sep-18 12:47 AM] vividfox11#3257
Hey man, i dont think thats cool calling people idiots for having their own identity, they wanna be able to know who they are in their own spectrum, not their fault most people think their identity isnt real, thing is, their identity is valid, their human beings who just want to be themselves their not aiming to hurt people, they are who they are and its not fair for them to be judged becuz of it
Just let them be who they are, dont call them idiots for being who they are cuz they are just being themselves, just dont be like that man
Maybe, but even still he was calling people idiots for having those said labels well atleast thats how i read it (idk if i read it wrong) and idk thats just not fair calling them idiots for their own identity yknow
Exactly yeah, i dont wanna start a fight, just want him to understand that what he said wasnt cool


[22-Sep-18 02:30 AM] totally not klop#0411
Wow now im getting criticized for venting
I rlly cant do shit here
And fyi i never called them idiots for being whatever they wamted
I said the idiots of this generation put a title on everything
So before u come at me read everything right
Not rlly it actually further complicates things but i dont deserved to be criticized because of my opinions and thoughts i thought that was the point of this channel to get things off your mind without any fear of any criticism or or judgment
That just goes to show that neither one of u rlly read what i said
Just skimming the top to find something to complain about
Because I clearly said be whatever the fuck you want to be just dont get mad when someone doesnt completely understand right out the gate
And thats my opinion am i not allowed to have those now?
Am i rlly that limited in my speech that i cant even saying a comment without a whole mob getting on my back
see this is what kills me about people u wanna go and be righteous and have movements blah blah blah but thats only when u can shame someone for not thinking like you do and thats what i rlly hate about 2018 i never said u couldnt be what u want or that is was wrong to be what you want i simply said giving titles to everything is idiotic and getting mad at someone who doesnt understand is even more so


[22-Sep-18 03:23 AM] unused account#5547

[22-Sep-18 03:29 AM] unused account#5547

[22-Sep-18 03:29 AM] vividfox11#3257

[22-Sep-18 03:32 AM] unused account#5547
ohhh id rather not talk about that! my rants over anyway >3<'


[22-Sep-18 03:35 AM] vividfox11#3257
Ah okie
@totally not klop#0411 hey man i dont want to argue i was just saying cuz of how u worded it u said "the idiots of this generation have to have a label on everything" and then u listed pan and genderfluid people and there are those people here on this server and what u said sounded like u were calling them idiots and it wasnt cool, just please let them be man
I get u wanna vent but please try to be mindful bout the people who read those stuff and who can see


[22-Sep-18 03:38 AM] totally not klop#0411
@vividfox11#3257 no i was just using it as an example
I could give 2 fucks what u wannabe a honestly
The intent wasnt to discriminate
It was obvious if u read the entire thing
I could have easily said some mean shit and all that about that but thats but that aint even in me


[22-Sep-18 03:40 AM] vividfox11#3257
Yeah but u used them as an example is the same as listing then im just saying the way u worded it wasnt nice man
And there are people here


[22-Sep-18 03:40 AM] unused account#5547
i think klop isn't upset over such things, i think he's upset over how important people make those things and how its a really big deal
im not one to voice opinions on such matters so i'll say nothing


[22-Sep-18 03:40 AM] totally not klop#0411
thank you
Exactly


[22-Sep-18 03:40 AM] vividfox11#3257

[22-Sep-18 03:40 AM] totally not klop#0411

Dont go straight into rant mode
Ill be more then happy to answer any questions


[22-Sep-18 03:42 AM] vividfox11#3257

Sorry for assuming


[22-Sep-18 03:42 AM] totally not klop#0411
